    <!--Fuck you, "oh I'm gonna look at the source I'm so smart" yeah well here it is you scumfuck,
      you're a fucking clown, I bet you did a little bit of web stuff in school or uni and think yourself a
      webdev as if that's a real job. You're utterly pathetic, go take up a real skill like plumbing or carpentry.-->

      <p>The world we’re speeding towards is one of despair, what little freedom we had within the confines of society is being evermore contracted. A collection of currently developing technology coupled with existing ones are but one push away from complete destruction of freedom. AI coupled with CCTV, bluetooth, GPS, IoT sysems and Big Data analysis would allow for every action in an urban enviroment to be documented, processed and analysed in seconds and this will inevitibly allow for certain traits or behaviours to be enforced at all times. Say an AI catches you stealing a glance at a coworker who you fancy and the company had a strict “no office dating” policy before you could even think a notification on your phone pops up of the AI reminding you of your contractual obligations to follow company policies and that this incident would be placed on your record, this enviroment would be sufficating at first but people would put up with it and change not only their behaviour but their thoughts to not attract the ire of the ever watchful eyes. Understanding of what chemicals make us happy could allow for manipulaiton of behaviour in the other way, taken to it’s most terrifying form imagine a soldier who upon completing an objective or defeating an enemy gets a heavy boost of dopamine or some such chemical putting you in a euphoric state, not only could this be used to make soldiers who have just done something that would make most people feel sick feel good but also your brain would start to associate those actions with feeling good. If those actions were shooting women and children in the back then you see the issue. Even the the most rabid of the SS units that shot children at point blank were on strong drugs and alchohol to complete their tasks, but this technology is allowing for an artificial carrot and stick to suppress any human urges such as love, empathy, compassion and hate when they’re not in the interest of whoever controls this technology. Machines are becoming like the old gods of antiquity, they watch over you constantly, if you please them you’re rewarded but go against them and they will strike you down with fury. The gods of the future will be the Human Resouces AI of Mitsubishi, Samsung or Facebook, the final stage of human domestication will begin, the future of what humanity even is will be entirely in the hands of those who rule or maybe of another machine.  The end result I can’t fully comprehend but the scariest thing of all is that this isn’t really some sci-fi distant stuff, these are all things that could created with existing technology after a short R&D phase. I have repeatedly said that we’re living in the world of cyberpunk, we just have the monotonous and unappealing aesthetics of real life. </p>

      <p>It has to be said, rebellion and reform against this civilisation is largely futile. The system gives you enough that your existence is tollerable. Hungry? McDonnalds has burgers from 99p, Bored? YouTube, Twitter, Netflix and Video Games can keep you entertained for years, Horny? PornHub, Tinder, Grindr, etc. Even if you feel that something is wrong and you hate what you see in the mirror you don’t have to  worry, you’re just ‘depressed’ , take these pills that’ll make it okay. In the end large numbers of people will play thousands of hours of a video games, watch just about as much TV, stuff their faces with fast food, jerk off to increasingly disturbing porn and turning to stronger and stronger drugs. They’re often unhealthy, unhappy and highly opinionated. Despite this they will repeat mantas and propaganda declaring this period of human history to be the best it has ever been. The arrow of history points towards “progress”.  The rate of domestication is likely as rapid now as it has ever been. </p>

      <p>As much as this ideal of reforming society is noble It’s largely a pipe dream, the addicts will demand violence, harrassment and shunning of those who make attempts. You try and take away their games, their shows, their porn or their drugs and they’ll scream bloody murder. Our civilisation is largely dead, the best course of action would be to attempt to break away but that is increasingly difficult to do and the existence of an alternative is seen as an afront to the system. If attempts to seperate from the greater society were to happen it would have to be done quietly and privately, as soon as a journalist discovers and reports on it you will enter the minds of the society and people will try to destroy what you have created. This happens every time anarchists create a working commune or free territory. Police and jernos will make out that it is dangerous, people will come in to try and exploit the commune/free territoy for their own criminal or political gain, this in turn boosts the argument of those jernos and cops and eventually the riot police move in and stomp it out. I do not claim to have an answer to this issue and I must remind you that not all problems can be solved, sometimes the ship has taken on too much water to be saved.</p>
